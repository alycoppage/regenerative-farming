            <h1>Regenerative Farming in Virginia</h1>
            <p>The effects of climate change are already being felt by millions of people around the world. From floods to heatwaves, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are already over <a href="https://www.who.int/heli/risks/climate/climatechange/en/" target="_blank">150,000 climate-related deaths</a> each year.</p>
            <p>Many things play into global warming, but one of the biggest factors is greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are trapped in the atmosphere and ultimately lead to warming. Pollution from cars, factories and energy systems are widely known negative contributors of these gases, but the other main contributor is agriculture and farming.</p>
            <p>With the current land and crop, livestock and manure management techniques that are used across the globe agriculture contributes <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank">to over 10%</a> of the greenhouse gas emissions as of 2019. Current practices allow loads of nitrous oxide, methane and other fossil fuels to be sent into the atmosphere rather than back into the soil.</p>
            <p>Farmers across the world are turning to a farming practice that helps to sequester carbon and other fossil fuels from the atmosphere in order to help keep the Earth’s atmosphere from its warming tipping point — between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>There is a growing number of farmers who have turned to regenerative farming because sustainable agriculture just isn’t enough — they now want to fully regenerate the land on which they farm.</p>
            <p>Plant beds and fields that are covered in vegetation are full of living roots in the soil — another main principle of regenerative agriculture. The important difference in this compared to modern agricultural practices is the technique of no-till farming. If the roots are kept in the ground with little to no disruption it allows plant and biotic life to thrive while sequestering and filtering more toxins from the air.</p>
            <p>Techniques such as this not only take out greenhouse gases from the atmosphere but also restore the land itself.</p>
            <p>A number of farms in Virginia have begun to utilize regenerative farming practices including decreasing disturbances to the soil life and increasing plant diversity by protecting and enhancing biotic and fungal networks underground.</p>
            <p>Regenerative farming is not only a way to fight the impact of climate change, but it also aims to work in harmony with nature and provide economic viability. Many practices, such as silvo pastures, create a mutually beneficial relationship between livestock, people and the land.</p>
            <p>Each farmer may have their own approach to regenerative farming, but a rule of thumb with regenerative agriculture is forgoing some modern farming practices like tilling, avoiding the use of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides and keeping the soil covered with vegetation. Some even say they are simply reverting to traditional ways of farming before mass-production demanded the use of large machinery and chemical production.</p>

            <h2>More thoughts on regenerative farming in Virginia</h2>
            <p>As the impending doom of climate change looms over everyone, there are some who choose to turn to hope and change, rather than despair.</p>
            <p>Humanity has progressed and changed because humans enact change. Many farmers who use regenerative farming techniques believe that they can be the change and make a difference — even if just on a small family farm.</p>
            <p>At its core, regenerative farming is making sure there are plenty of roots in the soil, cattle graze rotationally and vegetation is everywhere. But at the heart of regenerative farming is the hope of a tomorrow. A tomorrow that’s livable, climate goals have been achieved and where people can live harmoniously with nature.</p>
            <p>For Dr. Teel, seeing his ISAT students become practitioners of regenerative farming is the “ultimate goal.”</p>
            <p>“They can either do it in their backyard… if they live in suburbia or even an urban area, or if they can get involved with it in terms of jobs,” Dr. Teel said. “At some point, I would love to see more students go into agriculture.”</p>
            <p>Tackling climate change isn’t on just one individual. It’s a collective, worldwide initiative. Caroline Fleury, a staff member at Jubilee farms thinks that even one person or one small group can make a difference.</p>
