            <p>With years of environmental work behind him, Tom Benevento has plenty of new ideas on how to improve the environment even further. As the Sustainability Coordinator for Harrisonburg’s nonprofit, The New Community Project, Benevento recently had the opportunity to change local land into a carbon sequestration farm with beneficial science-proven techniques at work.</p>
            <p>The land was ******(HOW DID THEY GET IT)***** in ***WHEN *** and The New Community Project staff took lead with ideas of restorative farming to be implemented. The ****ACRE*** land has been partially converted to garden beds, ***WHAT ELSE -- SCIENCE NAMES LIKE RIPARIAN BUFFER, ETC**** .</p>
            <p>“Rockingham County is the heart of the agriculture in Virginia,” Dr. Teel, an Integrated science and technology professor (ISAT) at James Madison University said. “the surrounding counties have a lot of agriculture but Rockingham is the number one in the state.</p>
            <p>The farm, known as The Jubilee Climate Farm, has five full-time staff including Benevento and a large number of volunteers who cycle through to help get work done.  James Madison University students and professors are working on research along with physical labor through the restorative farm, to ensure the most amount of carbon can be sequestered through their agricultural techniques.</p>
            <p>So far with the help of many, Benevento has implemented the use of **(DOUBLE CHECK ACCURACY) BioReactor* fluids on **HOW MANY** garden beds to enhance the amount of biotic and fungal life among plant roots and soil. He has also been experimenting with specific plant types, trees and cover crops along and between the beds to find which has the highest impact on taking carbon out of the atmosphere. **HAS HE DONE OTHER THINGS**</p>
            <p>JMU students are also working on their capstone project at Jubilee and within the next few months, they hope to make a lot of advances. One thing they aim to have completed is to secure goats and a variety of fruit and nut trees for the, now empty, hillside of the farm and ultimately create a silvopasture.</p>
            <p>Silvopasture is the practice of utilizing animals to be mutually beneficial to crops and land through grazing and fertilization. This is one of many project ideas the staff is working on. After the winter season, Benevento and their team will reassess **(IS THIS ACCURATE)** the impacts of their work through soil testing and other research.</p>
            <p>*** SOMETHING FROM TOM ABOUT WHY THEY THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT**</p>

            <p>Along with restoring the environment, a primary main goal of this farm and its staff is to restore human connection and community. According to Benevento, a stronger connection with each other is at the core of what is important to them **(CHECK BUT HE SAID THAT TO ME BEFORE)**. </p>
            <p>Since 1988, Harrisonburg has become home to many refugees over the years. Benevento and The New Community Project house immigrants and refugees at one of their properties and try to provide as much support as they can throughout their work. On the Jubilee Climate Farm, some staff members and volunteers are from Mexico, Africa and other places across the globe and are working toward the mission of implementing successful restorative farming. They have also cleared a plot on the land for immigrant and refugee families in the area, who have a background in farming and agriculture, to be able to continue their passion and farm for free.</p>
            <p>The Jubilee Climate Farm may be a new addition to the area but they are making headway in their mission to find successful ways to restore the atmosphere and land through agricultural practices like regenerative farming. They plan to share the data they collect and proven beneficial techniques with a ****(THIS IS ON THE NEW INTERVIEW I BELIEVE BUT THEY WANNA MAKE AN ALLIANCE OR SOMETHING SO MORE FARMERS CAN TRY THESE PRACTICES)**.</p>
