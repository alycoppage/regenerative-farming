            <p>Good plains farm, located in the Shenandoah Valley, is a farm that’s been passed down from generation to generation. Originally owned by her grandfather, Kelly Hilliard - the current owner, has taken on the job of keeping up the farm.</p>
            <p>Attaining her Bachelors of Science in Agriculture and Life Sciences at Virginia Tech prior to becoming the sole owner of the farm, Kelly worked among various animals and knew that she always wanted to follow in her grandfather’s footsteps. Although she didn’t originally imagine herself becoming a farmer, she capitalized on the opportunity when it presented itself.</p>
            <p>Owning the farm as of 2017, Hilliard is running the farm all by herself. Doing it all on her own, with voluntary help from her husband and father, Hilliard has learned about regenerative farming from her own admission. Researching it, and seeing what other farmers were doing on their own farms in the area, Hilliard started implementing her own regenerative farming practices.</p>

            <p>“Our goal is to improve the overall land through the biodiversity of plant and animal life and mimicking the wild herbs that once moved across the Great Plains in tight packs. To do this, we use rotational grazing methods to create nutrient-dense meat that is high quality and delicious.”</p>
            <p>Continuous grazing and crop growing were done by Hilliard’s grandfather prior to her attaining the farm but now, she practices rotational grazing. This means that Hilliard moves her grazing cattle every day all throughout her land and in between grazing sessions she allows for the land that the cattle were previously on to rest and recover. She says that once she moves her cattle from a specific place, she lets the land stay cattle-free for at least 30 days.</p>
            <p>Her grandfather’s way of grazing, continuous grazing, let the cattle stay in one area for an undeclared amount of time and didn’t give his land any time to rest or recover — making crop preservation and growth more difficult.</p>
            <p>Hilliard has utilized the practice of rotational grazing for the past three years and has already noticed a tremendous difference. The edible part of the pasture forage plant has begun to flourish.</p>
            <p>Hilliard says that “regenerative agriculture is making more of what is there than was before.” She also claims that it’s not only beneficial short term, but long term as well. Regenerative farming techniques lend themselves to growing healthier, tastier food. Hilliard says that while it is more work to implement these regenerative practices, the outcome is worth the time commitment. Hilliard also says that regenerative farming has more growth potential than traditional farming methods.</p>
            <p>Hoping to leave the farm better than when she found it, and leave it for future generations to come, Hilliard says that she named the farm “Good Plains,” cleverly integrating her maiden name, as a way to recognize her family and as a promise to make the land better than it was before.</p>
